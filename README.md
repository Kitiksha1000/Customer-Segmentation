# Customer-Segmentation

## Objective:
This assignment involves performing data analysis and building predictive models for an eCommerce dataset consisting of three files: Customers.csv, Products.csv, and Transactions.csv. The goal is to provide actionable business insights, create a lookalike model for customer recommendations, and perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques.

## Assignment Structure:
The assignment consists of three primary tasks:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights

* Task Objective: Perform EDA on the dataset to understand patterns, trends, and key metrics.
* Deliverables: A Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA code and a PDF report summarizing 5 business insights derived from the data.
  
2. Lookalike Model

* Task Objective: Build a model that recommends the top 3 similar customers based on user profiles and transaction history.
* Deliverables: A CSV file (Lookalike.csv) mapping each customer to a list of recommended customers with similarity scores, along with a Jupyter Notebook explaining the model.
  
3. Customer Segmentation / Clustering

* Task Objective: Use clustering techniques to segment customers based on both their profiles and transaction data.
* Deliverables: A PDF report with clustering results, including the number of clusters formed, DB Index, and other relevant metrics, and a Jupyter Notebook containing the clustering code.
  
## Dataset Details:
* Customers.csv
Contains customer profile information such as CustomerID, CustomerName, Region, and SignupDate.

* Products.csv
Contains product details such as ProductID, ProductName, Category, and Price.

* Transactions.csv
Contains transaction details such as TransactionID, CustomerID, ProductID, TransactionDate, Quantity, TotalValue, and Price.
